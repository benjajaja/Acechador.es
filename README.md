Acechador.es
============

This is my main hobby project. It's a small and simple reddit-like website,
where users can submit links, comment and vote on them.

It is written in JavaScript for nodejs, using the express framework.
I chose to use closures over prototype.

Required npm modules:
connect, cron, express, gzip, html-minifier, imagemagick,
joosex-namespace-depended, json-template, connect-redis, db-mysql,
facebook-api, hash, http-proxy, joose, jqtpl, redis

I wasn't sure about the license, so I used the Affero GPL license, is like
GPLv3, but requires to publish changes to the source even if the software is
not ditributed but offered as a network service (like a website). If you want
to contribute to this project but the license is holding you back, contact me.
